# Website blocker
While I was starting to get distracted when studying, I decided to make a website blocker as a fun side project. This script will do the following:
- Block websites in a given timeframe 
%% Measures the time a user spends on one of the blocked-website, outside this timeframe
%% If the time consumption for that website is more than 2 hours, the user won't be able to visit the website for the next one day

## Learning goals
- Writing to a filesystem where a script can be run in the background

## Commands
```sudo node web_blocker.js```

## Technology
- NodeJS
- Javascript
