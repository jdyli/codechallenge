# Open AI

In April 2018 OpenAI has launched Gym where algorithms can be developed and compared with Reinforcement Learning. After a few months a new toolkit has been released that is build on top of Gym: Universe. According to OpenAI, Universe works by by automatically launching the program behind a VNC remote desktop — it doesn’t need special access to program internals, source code, or bot APIs.

In this project a bot-game will be developed by using Universe, where the bot learns to race by self-play.

## Learning goals

- How AI works in game technology, specifically reinforcement learning?
- What is Docker and how does it work?
- What is Universe and how does it work?

## Technology
- Python 2.7 (numpy)
- Docker
